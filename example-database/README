This directory contains an example BibTeX VCS database (without version control). The file
bibtexvcs.conf contains the main configuration, exampledb.bib is the BibTeX database, and
journals.txt contains journal names in abbreviated and full form; the two bib files
exampledb_abbr.bib and exampledb_full.bib are automatically generated by BibTeX VCS and contain
string definitions for these two versions.

Documents are contained in the Documents folder. They are linked to in the bib file in JabRef
style, i.e., by a field named "file" in the form

File = {:Helmling et al - Mathematical Programming Decoding of Binary Linear Codes.pdf:PDF}


To start from this example layout, modify to your needs and put under a supported VCS system.
Then open the folder with the BibTeX VCS gui program.
